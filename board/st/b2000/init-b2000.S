	 * command (redirecting the output), *without* needing any
	 * access to either a MicroConnect or a target board:
	 *
	 * host% romgen --show-comment dummy:b2000stxh415:st40,se=0
	 * or
	 * host% romgen --show-comment dummy:b2000stxh416:st40,se=0
	 *
	 * Where "dummy" need not correspond to any real IP address on
	 * your network.  In addition, note that "b2000stxh41x" should
	 * substituted if you have a custom target-pack connect command.
	 *
	 * It should be noted that the above command explicitly includes
	 * the option "se=0", which disables SE (or 32-bit) mode. This is
	 * correct, even though you may be using 32-bit mode at run-time.
	 * The "GDB pokes" are presently always executed in a 29-bit context,
	 * hence the need to disable 32-bit mode when running "romgen".
