	 * This file may be regenerated by executing the following
	 * command (redirecting the output), *without* needing any
	 * access to either a MicroConnect or a target board:
	 *
	 * host% romgen --show-comment dummy:b2037stxh205:host
	 *
	 * Where "dummy" need not correspond to any real IP address on
	 * your network.  In addition, note that "b2037stxh205" should
	 * substituted if you have a custom target-pack connect command.
	 *
	 * If you wish to boot from SPI Serial Flash in "Quad-Mode" (i.e.
	 * using 4 data wires), then you should also post-pend the "romgen"
	 * command with the "spi_4x=1" option. e.g.
	 *
	 * host% romgen --show-comment dummy:b2037stxh205:host,spi_4x=1,se=0
	 *
	 * It should be noted that the above command explicitly includes
	 * the option "se=0", which disables SE (or 32-bit) mode. This is
	 * correct, even though you may be using 32-bit mode at run-time.
	 * The "GDB pokes" are presently always executed in a 29-bit context,
	 * hence the need to disable 32-bit mode when running "romgen".
