	 * This file may be regenerated by executing the following
	 * command (redirecting the output), *without* needing any
	 * access to either a MicroConnect or a target board:
	 *
	 * host% romgen --show-comment dummy:fudb_gpd201:st40host,boot_companions=0,ddr_device=<chip>

	 * Where "dummy" need not correspond to any real IP address on
	 * your network.  In addition, note that "fudb_gpd201" should
	 * substituted if you have a custom target-pack connect command.
	 *
	 * The user must also provide a suitable value for the parameter "ddr_device",
	 * please see the file "fudb_gpd201.py" for a list of recognised values.
	 * e.g.:
	 *	ddr_device=ddr2_nanya_nt5tu64m16dg_be_777
	 *
	 * Note: The connect command used with "romgen", should connect
	 * only in 29-bit mode - even though U-Boot will be built for 32-bit mode.
	 * That is, do not use the "seuc=1" (or similar) option with "romgen".
