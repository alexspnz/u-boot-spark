	 * include the appropriate set of "GDB pokes", (usually) generated
	 * using the "romgen" utility, from a known good target-pack.
	 *
	 * In general, it is recommended to use "make romgen" to generate
	 * the set of "pokes" to include, after the board has been configured.
	 * It is possible to override, or augment, the default set of
	 * options passed to the underlying "romgen" utility, please see the
	 * top-level files "mkromgen", and "romgen-wrapper", for details
	 * of the relevant make environment variables.
	 *
	 * host% make romgen [variable=value ...]
	 *
	 * This file may also be regenerated by executing the following
	 * command (redirecting the output), *without* needing any
	 * access to either a MicroConnect or a target board:
	 *
	 * host% romgen --show-comment dummy:b2116stxh315:st40,se=0
	 * or
	 * host% romgen --show-comment dummy:b2116stxh315:a9_0
	 *
	 * Where "dummy" need not correspond to any real IP address on
	 * your network.  In addition, note that "b2116stxh315" should
	 * substituted if you have a custom target-pack connect command.
	 *
	 * Note: when using a revision "B" board, then it is essential
	 * that you also post-pend the "romgen" command with the extra
	 * ",boardrev=2" option. e.g.:
	 *
	 * host% romgen --show-comment dummy:b2116stxh315:st40,se=0,boardrev=2
	 * or
	 * host% romgen --show-comment dummy:b2116stxh315:a9_0,boardrev=2
	 *
	 * It should be noted that the above commands explicitly
	 * include the option "se=0", which disables SE (or 32-bit)
	 * mode on ST40 cores. This is correct, even though you may be
	 * using 32-bit mode at run-time.  On the ST40 core, the "GDB
	 * pokes" are presently always executed in a 29-bit context,
	 * hence the need to disable 32-bit mode when running "romgen".
	 * This option should not be used if the ARM is the boot-master.
