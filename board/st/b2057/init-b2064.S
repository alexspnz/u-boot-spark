	 * substituted if you have a custom target-pack connect command.
	 *
	 * It should be noted that the above command explicitly includes
	 * the option "se=0", which disables SE (or 32-bit) mode. This is
	 * correct, even though you may be using 32-bit mode at run-time.
	 * The "GDB pokes" are presently always executed in a 29-bit context,
	 * hence the need to disable 32-bit mode when running "romgen".
