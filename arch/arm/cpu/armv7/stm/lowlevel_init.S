	/*
	 * Next, we need to determine if we are already running in the
	 * correct location, or not; and if we are a master or a slave core.
	 *
	 * The 4 main possibilities are:
	 *
	 *		Core		Location
	 *		----		--------
	 *	1)	SLAVE-core	FLASH	(in the WRONG location)
	 *	2)	SLAVE-core	SDRAM	(in the correct location)
	 *	3)	MASTER-core	FLASH	(in the WRONG location)
	 *	4)	MASTER-core	SDRAM	(in the correct location)
	 *
	 * By "correct location", we mean the current PC agrees with
	 * the (virtual) address the program was originally linked against.
	 * So, we assume:
	 *	a) some "other" loader has executed the "poke-table"
	 *	b) some "other" loader has already initialized SDRAM
	 *	c) some "other" loader has loaded us into SDRAM
	 *	d) we are already running in SDRAM (not FLASH)
	 *	e) most of the low-level initialization has already been done.
	 *	f) we do not need to re-locate ourself at all.
	 *	g) we do not need to execute the "poke-table"
	 *
	 * Note: by "other" loader, we mean "GDB", or some other boot-loader
	 * (such as the "PBL") which is "chaining" us, such that we are in
	 * effect a secondary "boot-loader".
	 *
	 * By "wrong location", we mean the current PC does NOT agree with
	 * the (virtual) address the program was originally linked against.
	 * So, we assume:
	 *	a) nothing has executed the "poke-table" yet
	 *	b) nothing has initialized SDRAM yet
	 *	c) we are still running from FLASH (not SDRAM)
	 *	d) we do need to perform the low-level initialization
	 *	e) we do need to initialize SDRAM, before we use it
	 *	f) we do need to execute the "poke-table"
	 *	g) we do need to re-locate ourself to SDRAM
	 *
	 * By "master-core", we mean we are the "boot-master" (CPU #0),
	 * and we will:
	 *	a) exclusively run the "main" U-Boot program
	 *	b) initialize SDRAM - IF required
	 *	c) execute the "poke-table" - IF required
	 *	d) re-locate ourself to SDRAM - IF required
	 *	e) create the SRAM Holding-Pens (for the slaves)
	 *	f) "herd" (or marshal) the slaves through their Holding-Pens
	 *
	 * By "slave-core", we mean we are NOT the "boot-master", we will
	 * not run the U-Boot program, except the absolute minimum of code.
	 * Slaves will typically perform the following:
	 *	a) enter the "First" Holding-Pen ASAP
	 *	b) transition from the "First" Holding-Pen to the SRAM
	 *	   Holding-Pen, under control of the master-core.
	 *	c) transition from the "SRAM" Holding-Pen to the "payload"
	 *	   application (e.g. linux), under control of the master-core.
	 *	d) spend most time in a low-power mode ("WFE", or "WFI")
	 *	e) do not initialize SDRAM, or execute the "poke-table"
	 *	f) do not re-locate ourself to SDRAM
	 *	g) do not create the SRAM Holding-Pens
	 *
	 *
	 * All the slaves are treated the same, so there are only
	 * really 3 main "use-case" scenarios we need to consider:
	 *
	 *	------------------------------------
	 *
	 * 1)	SLAVE-core	FLASH *or* SDRAM
	 *
	 *	A slave-core is being booted, so we:
	 *		enter the "First" Holding-Pen
	 *		wait, and transition to the SRAM Holding-Pen
	 *		wait, and transition to "payload" application
	 *
	 *	This is equally applicable if we were booted directly
	 *	from FLASH, or if we are loaded via "GDB", or if we
	 *	were "chained" by some other boot-loader.
	 *
	 *	------------------------------------
	 *
	 * 2)	MASTER-core	FLASH	(in the WRONG location)
	 *
	 *	The master is being booted from FLASH, so we:
	 *		create the SRAM Holding-Pens (for the slaves)
	 *		"kick" slaves into SRAM Holding-Pen
	 *		execute the "poke-table".
	 *
	 *	This is typical, if we are booted directly from
	 *	FLASH, and we are a primary boot-loader.
	 *
	 *	------------------------------------
	 *
	 * 3)	MASTER-core	SDRAM	(in the correct location)
	 *
	 *	The master is being booted from SDRAM, so we:
	 *		create the SRAM Holding-Pens (for the slaves)
	 *		"kick" slaves into SRAM Holding-Pen
	 *		must NOT execute the "poke-table".
	 *
	 *	This is typical, if we are loaded via "GDB", or if we
	 *	are "chained" by some other boot-loader.
	 *
	 *	------------------------------------
